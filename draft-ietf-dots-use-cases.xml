 <abstract>

<t>The DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) effort is intended to provide a
dynamic solution for DDoS cooperation between networks to appropriately
react to DDoS attacks. This document presents use cases to evaluate the
interactions expected between the DOTS components as well as the DOTS
exchanges. The purpose of the use cases is to identify the interacting
DOTS components, how they collaborate and what are the types of
information to be exchanged.</t>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro"> 

<t>Currently, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack mitigation
solutions are largely based upon siloed, proprietary communications
schemes which result in vendor lock-in. As a side-effect, this makes
the configuration, provisioning, operation, and activation of these
solutions a highly manual and often time-consuming process.
Additionally, coordination of multiple DDoS mitigation solutions
simultaneously engaged in defending the same organization (resources)
against DDoS attacks is fraught with both technical and process-related
hurdles.  This greatly increase operational complexity and often results
in suboptimal DDoS attack mitigation efficacy. </t>

<t>The DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) effort is intended to specify a
protocol that facilitates interoperability between multivendor DDoS
mitigation solutions and ensures more automation in term of mitigation
requests and attack characterization patterns. As DDoS solutions are
broadly heterogeneous among different vendors, the primary goal for DOTS
is to provide a high level interaction with these DDoS solutions such as
initiating or terminating DDoS mitigation assistance.</t>

<t> It should be noted that DOTS is not in and of itself intended to
perform orchestration functions duplicative of the functionality being
developed by the <xref target="I2NSF"/> WG; rather, DOTS is intended to
allow devices, services, and applications to request DDoS attack
mitigation assistance and receive mitigation status updates.</t>

<t>These use cases are expected to provide inputs for the design of the
DOTS protocol(s).</t>

</section>

<section anchor="terms" title="Terminology and Acronyms">



<t>This document makes use of the terms defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-requirements" />.</t>

<t>In addition, this document introduces the following terms:

<list>

<t>Inter-domain: a DOTS communications relationship between distinct
organizations with separate spans of administrative control.  Typical
inter-domain DOTS communication relationships would be between a DDoS
mitigation service provider and an end-customer who requires DDoS
mitigation assistance; between multiple DDoS mitigation service
providers coordinating mutual defense of a mutual end-customer; or
between DDoS mitigation service providers which are requesting
additional DDoS mitigation assistance in for attacks which exceed their
inherent DDoS mitigation capacities and/or capabilities.</t>

<t>Intra- domain: a DOTS communications relationship between various
(network) elements that are owned and operated by the same
administrative entity.  A typical intra-domain DOTS communications
relationship would be between DOTS agents [I-D.ietf-dots-requirements]
within the same organization.
</t>

</list>
</t> 
</section>

<section title="Use Cases Scenarios">

<t>This section provides a high-level description of scenarios addressed
by DOTS. In both sub-sections, the scenarios are provided in order to
illustrate the use of DOTS in typical DDoS attack scenarios. They are
not definitive, and other use cases are expected to emerge with
widespread DOTS deployment.</t>

<t>All scenarios present a coordination between the targeted
organization, the DDoS attack telemetry and the mitigator.  The
coordination and communication between these entities depends, for
example, on the characteristic or functionality of the entity itself,
the reliability of the information provided by DDoS attack telemetry,
and the business relationship between the DDoS target domain and the
mitigator.</t>

<t>More explicitly, in some cases, the DDoS attack telemetry may simply
activate a DDoS mitigation, whereas in other cases, it may collaborate
by providing some information about an attack.  In some cases, the DDoS
mitigation may be orchestrated, which includes selecting a specific
appliance as well as starting/ending a mitigation. </t>
     

<section title="Inter-domain Use Cases" anchor="sec-upstream">

<section title="Enterprise with an upstream transit provider DDoS
mitigation Service" anchor="sec-entreprise-upsteam">

<!-- environment -->

<t>In this scenario, an enterprise network with self-hosted Internet-
facing properties such as Web servers, authoritative DNS servers, and
VoIP service platforms has a DDoS mitigation system (DMS)  deployed to
protect those servers, applications, and network resources from DDoS
attacks.  In addition to their on-premise DDoS defense capability, they
have contracted with their Internet access provider for DDoS mitigation
services which threaten to overwhelm their WAN interconnection link(s)
bandwidth.</t>

<t>The DMS is configured such that if the incoming Internet traffic
volume exceeds, e.g., 50% of the provisioned upstream Internet
interconnection link(s) capacity, the DMS will request DDoS mitigation
assistance from the upstream access provider. </t>
   
<t> Before any communication takes place between DOTS agents, security
credentials are provisioned on these agents so that only authorized 
entities can trigger mitigation actions. </t>   

<!-- dots relation -->  

<t>The communication to trigger, manage, and terminate a DDoS mitigation
between the enterprise DMS and the access provider(s) is performed using
DOTS.  The enterprise DMS implements a DOTS client while the access
provider implements a DOTS server. A DOTS client can establish
communications with multiple DOTS servers, if the enterprise is
multi-homed or of distinct access technologies are used (e.g., fixed,
LTE).</t>


<!-- attack - mitigation description --> 

<t>When the DMS detects an inbound DDoS attack targeting the enterprise
resources, it immediately begins mitigating the attack.</t>
 
<t>During the course of the attack, the inbound traffic volume exceeds
the 50% threshold; the DMS DOTS client signals its DOTS server(s) on the
upstream access provider network(s) to initiate DDoS mitigation
immediately.  The DOTS server signals the DOTS client that it can
service this request, and mitigation is initiated on the access provider
network.</t>
 
<t>Over the course of the attack, the DOTS server on the transit
provider network periodically signals the DOTS client on the enterprise
DMS in order to provide mitigation status information, statistics
related to DDoS attack traffic mitigation, and related information .
Such information are collected by the DOTS server, but the way these are
collected are outside of DOTS. Once the DDoS attack has ended, the DOTS
server signals the enterprise DMS DOTS client that the attack has
subsided. This signal may not be sent immediately, but once the peace
time is judged stable; the duration observation of the peace time after
an attack is deployment-specific. </t>
 
<t>The enterprise DMS then requests that DDoS mitigation services on
the upstream access provider network be terminated. The DOTS server on
the access provider network receives this request, communicates with the
access provider orchestration system controlling its DDoS mitigation
system to terminate attack mitigation, and once the mitigation has
ended, confirms the end of upstream DDoS mitigation service to the
enterprise DMS DOTS client.</t>

<t>Request termination will be repeated with each of the upstream DOTS
servers reachable through links that were under DDoS attack.</t>


</section>

<section title="Enterprise with a Cloud DDoS Mitigation Provider"
anchor="sec-cloud">

<!-- environment --> 

<t>This use case details an enterprise that has a local DDoS detection
and classification capability and may or may not have a mitigation
capability. The enterprise is contracted with a cloud DDoS mitigation
provider who can redirect (off-ramp) traffic away from the enterprise,
provide scrubbing services, and return “clean” traffic back to the
enterprise (on-ramp) on an ad-hoc, on demand basis. </t>

<t>The enterprise may, either by hard coding or on a case by case basis,
determine thresholds at which a request for mitigation is triggered
indicating to the cloud provider that traffic should be redirected and
scrubbed.</t>  

<!-- dots relation -->  

<t>The communication to trigger, manage, and terminate a DDoS mitigation
between the enterprise and the Cloud provider is performed using DOTS.
The enterprise implements a DOTS client while the Cloud Provider
implements a DOTS server.</t>

<t>The enterprise detection and classification systems encompass a DOTS
client and the cloud provider a DOTS server.</t> 

 
<!-- attack - mitigation description --> 

<t>When an attack is detected an automated or manual DOTS mitigation
request will be generated and sent to the cloud provider. The cloud
provider will assess the request for validity and if passed a mitigation
action may then be initiated. This action will usually involve the
off-ramp of all traffic destined to the target for further scrutiny and
filtering by the cloud provider. This should not only result in an
alleviation of pressure on the enterprise network but also on its
upstream provider and peers. How traffic redirection is implemented is
out of scope.</t>

<t>The cloud provider should signal via DOTS to the enterprise that a
mitigation request has been received and acted upon and should also
include a basic situational status of the attack.  The cloud provider
may respond periodically with additional updates on the status to enable
the enterprise to make an informed decision on whether to maintain or
cancel the mitigation.  An alternative approach would be for the DOTS
client mitigation request to include a time to live (TTL) for the
mitigation which may be extended by the client should the attack still
be ongoing as the TTL reaches expiration.</t>

<t>A variation of this use case may be that the enterprise is providing
a flow-based monitoring and analysis service to customers whose networks
may be protected by any one of a number of 3rd party providers. The
enterprise in question may integrate with these 3rd party providers
using DOTS and signal accordingly when a customer is attacked - the
enterprise may then manage the life-cycle of the attack on behalf of the
enterprise.</t>

<section title="Intra-domain Use Cases">

<section title="Homenet DDoS Detection Collaboration for ISP network management">

<!-- environment -->

<t>Home networks run with (limited) bandwidth as well as limited 
routing resources, while they are expected to provide services 
reachable from the outside <xref target="RFC7368"/>. This makes such
networks some easy targets to DDoS attacks via their WAN interface.
As these DDoS attacks are easy to perform, they may remain undetected 
by the upstream ISP. When the CPE is congested, the customer is 
likely to call the ISP hotline. In order to improve the quality of 
experience of the connectivity as well as to automate the request for
DDoS mitigation, ISPs are likely to consider a standard mean for CPEs 
to automatically inform a dedicated service mitigation platform when
they are under a suspected DDoS.</t>
 
<t>Note also that this section only considers DDoS attacks CPE or 
services in the home network are encountering. This differs from DDoS
attacks the CPE or any device within the home network may take part 
of - such as botnets. In the later attacks, the home network 
generates traffic under the control of a botmaster. Such attacks may 
only be detected once the attacks have been characterized. It would
be tempting to consider a feature in the DOTS protocol to allow a 
DOTS server to inform a CPE that some suspect traffic is being sent 
by the CPE so that appropriate actions are undertaken by the 
CPE/user. Nevertheless, this feature would require some interaction 
with the CPE administrator. Such scenario is outside the scope of 
this document.</t>

<t>In this use case, ISPs are willing to prevent their customer
undergoing DDoS attacks in order to enhance the quality of experience 
of their customers, to avoid unnecessary costly call on hot lines as 
well as to optimize the bandwidth of their network. A key challenge 
for the ISP is to detect DDoS attacks. In fact, DDoS detection is not 
only fine grained but is also expected to be different for each home 
network or small businesses networks (SOHO), and the ISP is unlikely 
to have sufficient resource to inspect the traffic of all its 
customers. </t>
 
<t>In order to address these challenges, ISPs are delegating the DDoS 
detection to CPE of home network or SOHO. Outsourcing the detection 
on the CPE provides the following advantages to the ISP: 1) Avoid 
the ISP to dedicate a huge amount of resource for deep packet 
inspection over a large amount of traffic with a specific security 
policies associated to each home network. It is expected that such 
traffic only constitutes a small fraction of the total traffic the
ISP is responsible for. 2) DDoS detection is deployed in a scalable 
way. 3) Provide more deterministic DDoS attack detection. For 
example, what could be suspected to be an UDP flood by the ISP may be 
consented by the terminating point hosted in the home network or
SOHO. In fact, without specific home network security policies, the 
ISP is likely to detect DDoS attack over regular traffic or to miss 
DDoS attacks targeting a specific home network or CPE. In the first 
case, this would result in the ISP spending unnecessary resources and 
in the second case this would directly impact the quality of 
experience of the customer.</t> 

<t>Note that in this scenario slightly differs from the "Enterprise 
with an upstream transit provider DDoS mitigation Service" scenario 
described in <xref target="sec-entreprise-upsteam"/>. In this 
scenario, the detection DDoS is motivated by the ISP in order to 
operate appropriately its network. For that purpose, it requires some 
collaboration with the home network. In <xref 
target="sec-entreprise-upsteam"/>, the target network requests a 
mitigation service from the upstream transit provider in order to 
operate its services. </t>

<t>Even though the motivations differ, there are still significant 
advantages for the home network to collaborate. On the home network 
or SOHO perspective such collaboration provides the following 
advantages: 1) If it removes the flows contributing to a DDoS attacks,
then it enhances the quality of experience of the users of the targeted
services or the entire home network. 2) If mitigation is being handled
by the ISP rather then the home network, then it reduces 
the management of DDoS attacks by the network administrator which 
involves detection as well as mitigation as well as the provisioning
of extra resources. 3) If the DDoS detection is based on information
specific to the home network, such as for example the description of
the services, the hosts capacities or the network topology, then 
performing the DDoS detection by the home network instead of the ISP
avoids the home network to leak private information to the ISP. In that
sense, it better preserves the home 
network or SOHO privacy while enabling a better detection. However, the 
request for mitigation may still leak some informations. ISPs must 
not retrieve sensitive data without the consent of the user. This is 
usually captured in administrative contracts that are out of scope of 
this document.</t>
      
<t>When the CPE suspects an attack, it notifies automatically or 
the ISP. The contact address of the DDoS Mitigation service 
of the ISP may be hard coded or may be configured manually or 
automatically (e.g., eventually the DHCP server may provide the DDoS 
mitigation service via specific DHCP options).</t>
<!-- dots relation -->  

<t>The communication to trigger a DDoS mitigation between the home
network and the ISP is performed using DOTS. The home network CPE
implements a DOTS client while the ISP implements a DOTS server. </t>

<!-- attack - mitigation description --> 
   
<t>The DOTS client on the CPE monitors the status of CPE's resource and
WAN link bandwidth usage. If something unusual happens based on
preconfigured throughput, traffic patter, explicit action from the user,
or some heuristics methods, the DOTS client sends a DOTS mitigation
request to the ISP DOTS server. Typically, a default configuration with
no additional information associated to the DOTS mitigation request is
expected.  The ISP derives traffic to mitigate from the CPE IP
address.</t>

<t>In some cases, the DOTS mitigation request contains options such as
some IP addresses or prefixes that belongs to a whitelist or a
blacklist. In this case, the white and black lists are not associated to
some analysis performed by the CPE -- as the CPE is clearly not expected
to analyze such attacks.  Instead these are part of some configuration
parameters. For example, in the case of small business, one may indicate
specific legitimate IP addresses such as those used for VPNs, or third
party services the company is likely to set a session.  Similarly, the
CPE may provide the IP addresses targeting the assets to be protected
inside the network. Note that the IP address is the IP address used to
reach the asset from the internet, and as such is expected to be globally
routable. Such options may include the IP address as well as a service
description. Similarly to the previous blacklist and whitelist, such
information are likely not derived from a traffic analysis performed by
the CPE, but instead are more related to configuration parameters.</t>
   
<t>Upon receiving the DOTS mitigation request, the DOTS server
acknowledges its reception and confirms DDoS mitigation starts or not.
Such feed back is mostly to avoid retransmission of the request.  </t>

<t>Note that the ISP is connected to multiple CPEs and as such the CPE
can potentially perform DDoS attack to the DOTS server. ISP may use
gateways to absorbs the traffic. These gateways, will typically aggregate
a smaller number of CPEs and retransmit to the destination DOTS Server a
selected information. Note that such gateways may somehow act as a DOTS
relay, which is implemented with a DOTS Server and a DOTS Client. Note
also that the case of a large DDoS attack targeting simultaneously
multiple CPEs is expected to be detected and mitigated by the upstream
architecture, eventually without DOTS alerts sent by each single CPE.
</t> 

<t>ISP may activate mitigation for the traffic associated to the CPE
sending the alert or instead to the traffic associated to all CPE.  Such
decisions are not part of DOTS, but instead depend on the policies of
the ISP.</t>
 

<t>It is unlikely the CPE will follow the status of the mitigation.
The ISP is only expected to inform the CPE the mitigation has been
stopped. </t>

<t>Upon receipt of such notification the CPE may, for example,
re-activate the monitoring jobs and thus is likely to provide some
further DOTS alert.</t>
 
</section>

<section title="DDoS Orchestration">


<!-- environment -->

<t>In this use case, one or multiple DDoS telemetry systems like a flow
collector monitor a network -- typically an ISP network. Upon detection
of a DDoS attack, these telemetry systems alert an orchestrator in
charge of coordinating the various DDoS mitigation systems within the
domain. The telemetry systems may be configured to provide some
necessary or useful pieces of information, such as a preliminary
analysis of the observation to the orchestrator.</t>

<t>The orchestrator analyses the various information it receives from
specialized equipment, and elaborates one or multiple DDoS mitigation
strategies. In some case, a manual confirmation may also be required to
choose a proposed strategy or to start the DDoS mitigation. The DDoS
mitigation may consists in multiple steps such as configuring the
network, the various hardware or already instantiated DDoS mitigation
functions. In some cases, some specific virtual DDoS mitigation
functions need to be instantiated and properly chained between each
other. Eventually, the coordination of the mitigation may involve
external DDoS resources such as a transit provider (<xref
target="sec-upstream"/>) or a cloud provider (<xref
target="sec-cloud"/>).</t> 


<!-- dots relation -->  

<t>The communication to trigger a DDoS mitigation between the telemetry
and monitoring systems and the orchestrator is performed using DOTS.
The telemetry systems implements a DOTS client while the Orchestrator
implements a DOTS server. </t>

<t>The communication between a network administrator and the
orchestrator is also performed using DOTS.  The network administrator
via its web interfaces implements a DOTS client while the Orchestrator
implements a DOTS server. </t>

<t>The communication between the Orchestrator and the DDoS mitigation
systems is performed using DOTS.  The Orchestrator implements a DOTS
client while the DDoS mitigation systems implement a DOTS server. </t>

<t>The configuration aspects of each DDoS mitigation systems, as well as
the instantiations of DDoS mitigation functions or network configuration
is not part of DOTS. Similarly the discovery of the available DDoS
mitigation functions is not part of DOTS.</t>

<!-- attack - mitigation description --> 

<t>The telemetry systems monitor various traffic network and perform
their measurement tasks. They are configured so that when an event or
some measurements reach a predefined level to report a DOTS mitigation
request to the Orchestrator. The DOTS mitigation request may be
associated with some element such as specific reporting.</t>

<t>Upon receipt of the DOTS mitigation request from the telemetry
system, the Orchestrator responds with an acknowledgement, to avoid
retransmission of the request for mitigation. The status of the DDoS
mitigation indicates the Orchestrator is in an analysing phase.  The
Orchestrator begins collecting various information from various
telemetry systems in order to correlate the measurements and provide an
analysis of the event. Eventually, the Orchestrator may ask additional
information to the telemetry system, however, the collection of these
information is performed outside DOTS.</t>

<t>The Orchestrator may be configured to start a DDoS mitigation upon
approval from a network administrator. The analysis from the
orchestrator is reported to the network administrator via a web
interface. If the network administrator decides to start the
mitigation, she orders through her web interface a DOTS client to send a
request for DDoS mitigation. This request is expected to be associated
with a context that identifies the DDoS mitigation selected.</t>

<t>Upon receiving the DOTS request for DDoS mitigation from the network
administrator, the orchestrator orchestrates the DDoS mitigation
according to the specified strategy.  Its status indicates the
DDoS mitigation is starting while not effective.</t>
   
<t>Orchestration of the DDoS mitigation systems works similarly as
described in <xref target="sec-upstream"/> and <xref
target="sec-cloud"/>.  The Orchestrator indicates with its status whether 
the DDoS mitigation is effective.</t>

<t>When the DDoS mitigation is finished on the DDoS mitigation systems,
the Orchestrator indicates to the telemetry systems as well as to the
network administrator the DDoS mitigation is finished.</t>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t> DOTS is at risk from three primary attacks: DOTS agent impersonation,
   traffic injection, and signaling blocking.  Associated security
requirements and additional ones are defined in  <xref
target="I-D.ietf-dots-requirements"/>.</t> 

<t> Impersonation and traffic injection mitigation can be managed
through current secure communications best practices.  DOTS is not
subject to anything new in this area.  One consideration could be to
minimize the security technologies in use at any one time.  The more
needed, the greater the risk of failures coming from assumptions on one
technology providing protection that it does not in the presence of
another technology.</t>
