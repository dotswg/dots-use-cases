    <abstract>


<t>The DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) effort is intended to provide a protocol
that facilitates interoperability between multivendor solutions/services.  This
document presents use cases to evaluate the interactions expected between the
DOTS components as well as the DOTS exchanges.  The purpose of the use cases is
to identify the interacting DOTS component, how they collaborate and what are
the types of information to be exchanged.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Currently, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack mitigation
solutions/services are largely based upon siloed, proprietary communications
paradigms which result in vendor/service lock-in.  As a side-effect, this makes
the configuration, provisioning, operation, and activation of these solutions a
highly manual and often time- consuming process.  Additionally, coordination of
multiple DDoS mitigation solutions/services simultaneously engaged in defending
the same organization against DDoS attacks is fraught with both technical and
process-related hurdles.  This greatly increase operational complexity and often
results in suboptimal DDoS attack mitigation efficacy.</t>

<t>The DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) effort is intended to provide a protocol
that facilitates interoperability between multivendor DDoS mitigation
solutions/services.  As DDoS solutions/services are broadly heterogeneous among
different vendors, the primary goal for DOTS is to provide a high level
interaction with these DDoS solutions/services such as initiating or terminating
DDoS mitigation assistance.</t>

<t>It should be noted that DOTS is not in and of itself intended to perform
orchestration functions duplicative of the functionality being developed by the
[I2NSF] WG; rather, DOTS is intended to allow devices, services, and
applications to request DDoS attack mitigation assistance and receive mitigation
status updates from systems of this nature.</t>

<t>The use cases presented in the document are intended to provide examples of
communications interactions DOTS-enabled nodes in both inter- and
intra-organizational DDoS mitigation scenarios.  These use cases are expected to
provide inputs for the design of the DOTS protocol(s).</t>

<t>Inter-organizational: a DOTS communications relationship between distinct
organizations with separate spans of administrative control.  Typical
inter-organizational DOTS communication relationships would be between a DDoS
mitigation service provider and an end-customer organizational which requires
DDoS mitigation assistance; between multiple DDoS mitigation service providers
coordinating mutual defense of a mutual end-customer; or between DDoS mitigation
service providers which are requesting additional DDoS mitigation assistance in
for attacks which exceed their inherent DDoS mitigation capacities and/or
capabilities.</t>

<t>Intra-organizational: a DOTS communications relationship between various
elements within a single span of administrative control.  A typical
intra-organizational DOTS communications relationship would be between DOTS
clients, DOTS gateways, and DOTS servers within the same organization.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="use-case-scenarios" title="Use Cases Scenarios">

<t>This section provides a high-level description of scenarios addressed by DOTS.
In both sections, the scenarios are provided in order to illustrate the use of
DOTS in typical DDoS attack scenarios.  They are not definitive, and other use
cases are expected to emerge with widespread DOTS deployment.</t>

<t>All scenarios present a coordination between the targeted organization, the DDoS
attack telemetry and the mitigator.  The coordination and communication between
these entity depends, for example on the characteristic or functionality of the
equipment, the reliability of the information provided by DDoS attack telemetry,
and the business relationship between the DDoS target domain and the mitigator.</t>

<t>More explicitly, in some cases, the DDoS attack telemetry may simply activate a
DDoS mitigation, whereas in other cases, it may collaborate by providing some
information about an attack.  In some cases, the DDoS mitigation may be
orchestrated, which includes selecting a specific appliance as well as
starting/ending a mitigation.</t>

<section anchor="interdomain-use-cases" title="Inter-domain Use Cases">

<section anchor="interdomain-upstream-mit" title="Enterprise with an upsteam transit provider DDoS mitigation Service">

<t>In this scenario, an enterprise network with self-hosted Internet-facing
properties such as Web servers, authoritative DNS servers, and VoIP PBXes has an
intelligent DDoS mitigation system (IDMS) deployed to protect those servers and
applications from DDoS attacks.  In addition to their on-premise DDoS defense
capability, they have contracted with their Internet transit provider for DDoS
mitigation services which threaten to overwhelm their transit link bandwidth.</t>

<t>The IDMS is configured such that if the incoming Internet traffic volume exceeds
50% of the provisioned upstream Internet transit link capacity, the IDMS will
request DDoS mitigation assistance from the upstream transit provider.</t>

<t>The communication to trigger, manage, and finalize a DDoS mitigation between the
enterprise IDMS and the transit provider is performed using DOTS.  The
enterprise IDMS implements a DOTS client while the transit provider implements a
DOTS server.</t>

<t>When the IDMS detects an inbound DDoS attack targeting the enterprise servers
and applications, it immediately begins mitigating the attack.</t>

<t>During the course of the attack, the inbound traffic volume exceeds the 50%
threshold; the IDMS DOTS client signals the DOTS server on the upstream transit
provider network to initiate DDoS mitigation.  The DOTS server signals the DOTS
client that it can service this request, and mitigation is initiated on the
transit provider network.</t>

<t>Over the course of the attack, the DOTS server on the transit provider network
periodically signals the DOTS client on the enterprise IDMS in order to provide
mitigation status information, statistics related to DDoS attack traffic
mitigation, and related information.  Once the DDoS attack has ended, the DOTS
server signals the enterprise IDMS DOTS client that the attack has subsided.</t>

<t>The enterprise IDMS then requests that DDoS mitigation services on the upstream
transit provider network be terminated.  The DOTS server on the transit provider
network receives this request, communicates with the transit provider
orchestration system controlling its DDoS mitigation system to terminate attack
mitigation, and once the mitigation has ended, confirms the end of upstream DDoS
mitigation service to the enterprise IDMS DOTS client.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="interdomain-cloud-mit" title="Enterprise with on Cloud DDoS mitigation provider">

<t>This use case details an enterprise that has a local DDoS detection and
classification capability and may or may not have a mitigation capability.  The
enterprise is contracted with a cloud DDoS mitigation provider who can redirect
(offramp) traffic away from the enterprise, provide scrubbing services and
return clean traffic back to the enterprise (onramp) on an ad-hoc, on demand
basis.</t>

<t>The enterprise may, either by hard coding or on a case by case basis, determine
thresholds at which a request for mitigation is triggered indicating to the
cloud provider that traffic should be redirected and scrubbed.</t>

<t>The communication to trigger, manage, and finalize a DDoS mitigation between the
enterprise and the Cloud provider is performed using DOTS.  The enterprise
implements a DOTS client while the Cloud Provider implements a DOTS server.</t>

<t>The enterprise detection and classification systems encompass a DOTS client and
the cloud provider a DOTS server.</t>

<t>When an attack is detected an automated or manual DOTS mitigation request will
be generatd and sent to the cloud provider.  The cloud provider will assess the
request for validity and if passed a mitigation action may then be initiated.
This action will usually involve the offramp of all traffic destined to the
target for further scrutiny and filtering by the cloud provider.  This should
not only result in an alleviation of pressure on the enterprise network but also
on its upstream provider and peers.</t>

<t>The cloud provider should signal via DOTS to the enterprise that a mitigation
request has been received and acted upon and should also include a basic
situational status of the attack.  The cloud provider may respond periodically
with additional updates on the status to enable the enterprise to make an
informed decision on whether to maintain or cancel the mitigation.  An
alternative approach would be for the DOTS client mitigation request to include
a time to live (ttl) for the mitigation which may be extended by the client
should the attack still be ongoing as the ttl reaches expiration.</t>

<t>A variation of this use case may be that the enterprise is providing a flow
based monitoring and analysis service to customers whose networks may be
protected by any one of a number of 3rd party providers.  The enterprise in
question may integrate with these 3rd party providers using DOTS and signal
accordingly when a customer is attacked - the enterprise may then manage the
life-cycle of the attack on behalf of the enterprise.</t>

<section anchor="intradomain-use-cases" title="Intra-domain Use Cases">

<section anchor="intradomain-homenet" title="Homenet DDoS protection by ISP">

<t>In this use case home networks or small businesses networks (SOHO), subscribe
with their upstream ISP a DDoS mitigation service.</t>

<t>Home networks run with limited bandwidth as well as limited routing resources,
while they are expected to provide services reachable from the outside
<xref target="RFC7368"></xref>.  This makes such organizations some easy targets to DDoS attacks. In
addition, these DDoS attacks might even not be noticed by the upstream ISP.</t>

<t>This scenario is considered as an intra-domain as ISPs have a specific
relationship with these customers.  The ISP is the connectivity provider, and in
some cases, they even provides the CPE with a set of associated services.
Moreover, in case of any connectivity issue the customer is likely to call the
hotline.  In order to improve the QoS of the connectivity as well as to automate
the request for DDoS mitigation, ISP is likely to consider a standard mean for
CPEs to notify when they are under a suspected DDoS.  Such notification may be
triggered automatically or manually.  As the ISP and the customer share a common
interest in mitigating the DDoS attack, this slightly differs from cases where a
contract is negotiated with a third party, such as in the inter-domain use
cases.</t>

<t>In most cases, CPEs are unlikely to diagnose whether an DDoS attack is ongoing
or not and simply rely on the upstream equipment provided by the ISP for
detection and potential mitigation.</t>

<t>The DDoS Mitigation service of the ISP may be hard coded or may be configured by
the customer manually or automatically while the CPE is being connected to the
Internet -- eventually the DHCP server may provide the DDoS Mitigation service
via specific DHCP options.</t>

<t>The communication to trigger a DDoS mitigation between the home network and the
ISP is performed using DOTS.  The home network CPE implements a DOTS client
while the ISP implements a DOTS server.</t>

<t>The DOTS Client on the CPE monitors the status of CPE&rsquo;s resource and link
bandwidth usage.  If something unusual happens based on preconfigured throughput
or some heuristics methods, the DOTS Client sends a DOTS mitigation request to
the ISP DOTS Server.  Typically, a default configuration with no additional
information associated to the DOTS mitigation request is expected.  The ISP
derives traffic to mitigate from the CPE IP address.</t>

<t>In some cases, the DOTS mitigation request contains options such as some IP
addresses or prefixes that belongs to a whitelist or respectively to a
blacklist.  In this case, the white and black lists are not associated to some
analysis performed by the CPE -- as the CPE is clearly not expected to analyze
such attacks.  Instead these are part of some configuration parameters.  For
example, in the case of small business, one may indicate specific legitimate IP
addresses such as those used for VPNs, or third party services the company is
likely to set a session.  Similarly, the CPE may provides the IP addresses of
the assets to be protected inside the network.  Such options may include the IP
address as well as a service description.  Similarly to the previous blacklist
and whitelist, such information are not derived from a traffic analysis
performed by the CPE, but instead are more related to configuration parameters.</t>

<t>Upon receiving the DOTS mitigation request, the ISP acknowledges its reception
and confirms DDoS mitigation starts or not.  Such feed back is mostly to avoid
retransmission of the request.</t>

<t>Note that the ISP is connected to multiple CPEs and as such the CPE can
potentially perform DDoS attack to the DOTS server.  ISP may use relays to
absorbs the traffic.  In addition, such attack may be triggered by a large scale
DDoS attack, which is expected to be detected and mitigated by the upstream
architecture.</t>

<t>ISP may activate mitigation for the traffic associated to the CPE sending the
alert or instead to the traffic associated to all CPE.  Such decisions are not
part of DOTS, but instead depend on the policies of the ISP network
administrator.</t>

<t>It is unlikely the CPE will follow the status of the mitigation.  The ISP is
only expected to inform the CPE the mitigation has been stopped.</t>

<t>Upon receipt of such notification the CPE may re-activate the monitoring jobs
and thus is likely to provide some further DOTS alert.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="intradomain-ddos-orchestration" title="DDoS Orchestration">

<t>In this use case, one or multiple telemetry systems or monitoring devices like a
flow collector monitor a network -- typically an ISP network.  Upon detection
of a DDoS attack, these telemetry systems alert an orchestrator in charge of
coordinating the various DDoS mitigation systems within the domain.  The
telemetry systems may be configured to provide some necessary or useful pieces
of informations, such as a preliminary analysis of the observation to the
orchestrator.</t>

<t>The orchestrator analyses the various information it receives from specialized
equipements, and elaborates one or multiple DDoS mitigation strategies.  In some
case, a manual confirmation may also be required to chose a proposed strategy or
to start the DDoS mitigation.  The DDoS mitigation may consists in multiple
steps such as configuring the network, the various hardware or already
instantiated DDoS mitigation functions.  In some cases, some specific virtual
DDoS mitigation functions need to be instantiated and properly chained between
each other.  Eventually, the coordination of the mitigation may involved
external DDoS resources such as a transit provider <xref target="interdomain-upstream-mit"/>
or a cloud provider <xref target="interdomain-cloud-mit"/>.</t>

<t>The communication to trigger a DDoS mitigation between the telemetry and
monitoring systems and the orchestrator is performed using DOTS. The telemetry
systems implements a DOTS client while the Orchestrator implements a DOTS
server.</t>

<t>The communication between to select a DDoS strategy by a network administrator
and the orchestrator is also performed using DOTS.  The network administrator
via its web interfaces implements a DOTS client while the Orchestrator
implements a DOTS server.</t>

<t>The communication between the Orchestrator and the DDoS mitigation systems is
performed using DOTS.  The Orchestrator implements a DOTS client while the DDoS
mitigation systems implement a DOTS server.</t>

<t>The configuration aspects of each DDoS mitigation systems, as well as the
instantiations of DDoS mitigation functions or network configuration is not part
of DOTS.  Similarly the discovery of the available DDoS mitigation functions is
not pat of DOTS.</t>

<t>The Telemetry or monitoring systems monitors each various traffic network and
each performs their measurement tasks.  They are configure so that when an event
or some measurements reach a predefined level to report a DOTS mitigation
request to the orchestrator.  The DOTS mitigation request may be associated with
some element such as specific reporting, or analysis.</t>

<t>Upon receipt of the DOTS mitigation request from the telemetry system, the
orchestrator responds with an acknowledgement, to avoid retransmission of the
request for mitigation.  The status of the DDoS mitigation indicates the
orchestrator is in an analysing phase.  The orchestrator begins collecting
various informations from various telemetry systems on the network in order to
correlate the measurements and provide an analyse of the event.  Eventually, the
orchestrator may ask additional informations to the telemetry system that just
sent the DOTS request, however, the collection of these information is performed
outside DOTS.</t>

<t>The orchestrator may be configured to start a DDoS mitigation upon approval from
a network administrator.  The analysis from the orchestrator is reported to the
network administrator via a web interface.  If the network administrator decides
to start the mitigation, she order through her web interface a DOTS client to
send a request for DDoS mitigation.  This request is expected to be associated
with a context that identifies the DDoS mitigation selected.</t>

<t>Upon receiving the DOTS request for DDoS mitigation from the network
administrator, the orchestrator orchestrates the DDoS mitigation according to
the specified strategy.  It status first indicates the DDoS mitigation is
starting while not effective.  In fact the orchestrator is expected to proceed
to a significant number of configurations.</t>

<t>Orchestration of the DDoS mitigation systems works similarly as described in
<xref target="interdomain-upstream-mit"/> or <xref target="interdomain-cloud-mit"/>.  The orchestrator
indicates with its status the DDoS Mitigation is effective.</t>

<t>When the DDoS mitigation is finished on the DDoS mitigation systems, the
orchestrator indicates to the Telemetry systems as well as to the network
administrator the DDoS mitigation is finished.</t>

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>DOTS is at risk from three primary attacks: DOTS agent impersonation, traffic
injection, and signaling blocking.  The DOTS protocol MUST be designed for
minimal data transfer to address the blocking risk.</t>

<t>Impersonation and traffic injection mitigation can be managed through current
secure communications best practices.  DOTS is not subject to anything new in
this area.  One consideration could be to minimize the security technologies in
use at any one time.  The more needed, the greater the risk of failures coming
from assumptions on one technology providing protection that it does not in the
presence of another technology.</t>
